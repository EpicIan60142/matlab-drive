%% Matrices

%2d vectors - draw a picture?

%% indexing into a matrix

mat = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
middle = mat(2,2); %(row, column) ...  must specify both! not just one!
corner = mat(1,3); %upperRight
otherCorner = mat(3,1); %lowerLeft

firstRow = mat(1,:); % (1,:) = (row 1, all the columns)
firstCol = mat(:,1); % (:,1) = (all the rows, column 1)

%specific rows/cols
topCorner = mat(1:2, 2:3); %(1:2, 2:3) = (rows 1-2, columns 2-3)
middleSection = mat(2, 1:2); %(2, 1:2) = (row 2, columns 1-2)

%% creating template matrices
onesMat = ones(2,3);
squareOnesMat = ones(5);

zerosMat = zeros(2,3);
squareZerosMat = zeros(5);

%% size and length of vectors and matrices
A = [1:5; 2:6; 7:11];
B = [2,6,3,2,75,2];

sizeA = size(A);
lengthB = length(B);

%% bring it all together for some matrix/vector math

% there were four children
children = ones(1,4);

%each child's costume was rated on cuteness, creativity, style, and effort
ratings = [0,7,10,8; 6,10,1,5; 1,5,2,3; 8,4,9,3];

%amount of candy each child earned by the end of the night
candyTotal = ratings*children'; %  note we have to transpose "children" because 
                                %  you cannot multiply a 4x4 by a 1x4, must
                                %  make it 4x4 times 4x1
                                %  NOT necessary for scalar multiplication
                                
%they each got an extra 5 pieces from their mom
candyTotal = candyTotal + 5; %this adds 5 to every element of the matrix

%sort the children by how much candy they got - remember bubble sort?
sortedCandy = bubbleSort(candyTotal);

%% more function notes

%functions do not always have to return anything
    %can use no-output functions for printing, plotting, etc.
HalloweenMsg("Lyndsay");
    %can also use no-input functions, just use empty parenthesis
