function dX = inertialFeedbackControlRadFF(t, X, offset, kConst, pConst)
% Function that implements an inertial feedback control law for relative
% motion between a chief and deputy spacecraft, feeding forward for a
% constant radial offset from the chief
%   Inputs:
%       - t: Current integration time in sec
%       - X: Current combined state vector as follows:
%            X = [X_c; X_d]
%       - offset: Radial offset in the radial direction
%       - kConst: Structure of control gains with K1 and K2 as fields
%       - pConst: Planetary constants vector containing mu for the
%                 celestial body of interest
%   Outputs:
%       - dX: Rate of change vector as follows:
%             [dX_c; dX_d]
