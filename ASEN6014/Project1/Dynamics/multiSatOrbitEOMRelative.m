function dX = multiSatOrbitEOMRelative(t, X, pConst, scConst, disturb)
% Function that integrates chief motion and multiple deputies at the same
% time
%   Inputs:
%       - t: Current integration time
%       - X: State vector of n stacked satellite states, like so:
%            [X_chief; X_deputy1; ...; X_deputyN], where 
%            X_chief = [X; Y; Z; Xdot; Ydot; Zdot] in the inertial frame 
%              and
%            X_deputyN = [x; y; z; xDot; yDot; zDot] in the Hill frame
%       - pConst: Planetary constants structure containing Ri, mu, and J2
%       - scConst: Vector of spacecraft parameter structures containing
%                  mass, coefficient of drag, and cross-sectional area
%       - disturb: Boolean of disturbances to include or ignore in the
%                  following order for each satellite:
%           - J2: Include (true), ignore (false)
%           - Drag: Include (true), ignore (false)
%                  disturb = [disturb_sat1, disturb_sat2, ...,
%                             disturb_satn]
%   Outputs:
%       - dX: Rate of change of the state vectors, like so:
%             [dX_1; dX_2; ...; dX_n]
